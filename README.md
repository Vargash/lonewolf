A simple character sheet to play the Choose Your Own Adventure books of the Lone Wolf series

## TL;DR

Click [here](http://lonewolf.yvesgurcan.com/build) and open [Project Aon](https://www.projectaon.org/en/Main/Books) in a new tab. Choose the book you want to start on both interfaces. Follow the instructions of the book to create your character. You're all set for our adventures.

## Why this app?

Ever played the Choose Your Own Adventure Books, back in the 80s-90s? Remember how you had to turn to the right section of the book as you progressed in the story? I used to read these during long journeys--always had pen and paper ready in the pre-mass Internet age. Anyway.

As time passed, I grew nostalgic. These books, the Lone Wolf series, had something special about them. Unfortunately, I don't know what happened to my collection, so I couldn't fulfill the desire to play my own adventure again. I looked on the Internet to see if I could find one for sale, but that led nowhere... Until I found Project Aon. A wonderful project that digitized all the Lone Wolf books.

I like my pen and paper, but they get a little cumbersome. Without hesitation, I started creating a simple user interface so that I could play on the go. I was inspired by the template for the character sheet from the book, and started enhancing the UI to make it even more mobile-friendly.

Within a few weeks, I had put together a little web app that kept track of my progression automatically. Now, I can indulge whenever I feel like going back to these very special childhood memories.

## How to use the character sheet

Go to [Project Aon](https://www.projectaon.org/en/Main/Home>). You can start your adventure with any of the Lone Wolf books.

To start Â your character sheet, browse to [this page](http://lonewolf.yvesgurcan.com/build). Here, you can keep track of your character on the go.

Your character sheet is saved locally automatically. When you reload the page from the same device, the character sheet should be restored to the state you left it--unless you clear your browser cache.

You can also copy the current game state and paste it back in the dedicated field at any point. Remote loading/saving is password-protected.

### Select a book

Once you have chosen which Lone Wolf book you will play, make sure to select the corresponding Book option from the list on the character sheet. Enter 1 under the Section field. Links will be automatically generated so that you can quickly access the table of content of the book, the map of the world you are playing in, and the numbered section where you left the game.

### Enter your combat skill

Follow the instructions provided in the book to create your character. Enter your combat skill score under Base Combat Skill and click on Update Combat Skill to populate the field underneath. It might seem redundant at first to have two fields to keep track of your combat skill, but this enhancement will prove to be very useful when the elements that influence your combat skill change.
